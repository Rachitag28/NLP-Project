@tedcruz And, she wiped clean + 30k deleted emails, explains dereliction of duty/lies re etc 
Hillary is our best choice if we truly want to continue being a progressive nation. 
@TheView I think our country is ready for a female pres, it can't ever be Hillary 
I just gave an unhealthy amount of my hard-earned money away to the big gov't & untrustworthy IRS. 
@PortiaABoulger Thank you for adding me to your list 
Hillary can not win. Here's hoping the Dems offer a real candidate like Warren. 
Respect FOR the law and respect BY the law Yes, needed desperately. 
I don't want to be appointed to an Ambassador post. 
@HillaryClinton if there was a woman with integrity and honesty I would vote for such as woman president, NO 
@HillaryClinton End lawless Jail Butcher of rapist 
Use your brain, keep Hillary out of the White House.Clinton2016 
@HillaryClinton Hillary pandering with her logo. 
@readyforHRC @HillaryClinton the US presidency is a testament to the success of their role in the world 
@CiaraAntaya cuz you know I'm such a feminist 
2 million bogus followers on Twitter @HillaryClinton 
@lindasuhler : My name is Rebecca and my grandmother immigrated to Sunnybrook Farm. @twitchyteam 
Where's the campaign store is the real question? I am ready to buy some Hillary gear 
It's a miracle, suddenly don't mind having someone who voted for war. 
@smileitsalicia @greekgummybear2 now i can live in peace 
Hillary doesn't want to put anyone in prison anymore. Obviously worried about her own future. 
The only way I support Hillary was if Elizabeth Warren ran or Karl Marx was running 
@HomeOfUncleSam @ScotsFyre @RWNutjob1 @SA_Hartdegen She's too old to understand the internet...that she can be fact checked. 
Because Communist Breadlines are not my thing! 
@HillaryClinton bad wife, bad role model for women, bad lawyer, bad First Lady, bad Senator, horrible Secretary of State. 
Everything Hillary touches ends up being a scam, a lie, a cover-up, or a failure. William L. Just who we want as president. 
Yes HRC subject 2 dbl standard Smh Come on @billclinton @HillaryClinton U Knew @ClintonFdn Donations Would b Scrutinized; Spun! 
to stop for today to garner the vote. is worthless. 
I want America to great again 
March 8, 2016 Ohio is holding our Primaries! The date is subject to change. 
@RIGHTZONE @WethePeoplePets Let's hope the VOTERS remember! 
Hillary Clinton has not driven a car since 1996. 
@NaughtyBeyotch @TheRealMadman23 Don't care for but it seems she taking the gut punches by the 
@FoxNews @marthamaccallum @BillHemmer whose the opportunist now, 
@HillaryClinton @WomenintheWorld we need to re-establish a system dominated by love and affection have RT 
is as transparent as a brick wall 
@WSJ . Clinton Foundation to keep accepting bribes from foreign governments 
@josephbenning I agree, these are better than what you had before, like a severe cold is better than pneumonia. Good luck. 
What are you afraid of @HillaryClinton? If you can't answer questions from the press, why do we want you as POTUS 
Sorry, Hillary's new normal folk image doesn't take away from Behgnazi & her 0 foreign policy successes as Secretary of State. 
CEO pay the target for 2016 election. From someone who makes more than most CEO's but you drank the Kool-Aid. 
@NBCNews including repealing the first amendment. Way to go 
@NBCNews Stop promoting @HillaryClinton. She is a liar. Just like her impeached husband. 
Lets take back our country! Whos with me? No more Democrats!2016 
RT @AnthonyCumia: If Hillary IS elected, I have my transition team together to smoothly move me from a racist to a sexist. 
I'm who got kicked off the team due to misconduct. 
.@HillaryClinton is a droid & someone's programmed her to say things - thinks she doesn't have to WORK to win so she ISN'T! 
@JVollmer08 @HillaryforIA for innovation and development to make i Utopia 
Probably not perfect for everyone--which I think is great. But this is the beginning of a conversation. 
I'm on the edge of my seat to start volunteering for @HillaryClinton 's presidential campaign! So excited!! 
RT @FutureTXLeader: Is everyone in ready for president 
Just laid down the law on abortion in my bioethics class. 
@tooprettyclub Are you OK with males telling you what you can and can't do with your own body? 
If you don't want your kid, put it up for adoption. 
@RedAlert -there should be a "stigma" to butchering pre-born children - its a horrendous crime against humanity. 
But isn't that the problem then. Not enough faith. 
Life is our first and most basic human right. 
Rise & Shine its a new day & you're alive. Thank God 4 another day of precious life. 
Lmao my school thinks giving women the right to an abortion is against feminism. They don't know feminism 
@AsaSoltan putting abortion in with choices for women just won my heart over. Yaaaaaas! 
Last meeting of the year tonight! 7:00 pm in Case Hall room 334A. Come one come all! Pizza and pop will be provided! 
FACT: 17% of today's population is equivalent to residents in New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Where's the outrage for this? 
They say God isn't listening? Just look at that radar today. 
If you believe in its power; then pray. 
Planned Parenthood lines its pockets while sacrificing women and children in need at the altar of abortion. 
It is not progressive to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life. - 
RT @TheKeyisPrayer: "No law can give me the right to do what is wrong." -Abraham Lincoln 
We live in a world where people care more about religious rights than consent & reproductive rights.... 
we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts - Mother Teresa 
Life, what a beautiful choice. Adoption. Not abortion. 
My teacher today basically said that embroyo's are nothing but skin + blood & that abortion was fine. 
@ShowTruth Keeping pregnant people safe is a great reason for abortion, though. 
@rosaryrevival When we lest we forget to 
@RefCom_ie get more on is stuck. We'll 
Yep. RT: "Defunding PP won't mean fewer abortions. It will mean more dead women. 
@mrprolife You would force a woman to risk her health, sanity, and life, to continue a doomed pregnancy. Against her will. No. 
Whether someone wants to have children or not should be completely up to the person carrying that pregnancy... 
I will agree to gay marriage if you agree to pro-life and then adopt babies that would have been aborted. 
On Manila TV,Monday: appeals to @IndonesiaPresident -don't execute 
Too far? Sorry so is he 
I watched and it gave me a whole new perspective on a woman's right to choose. 
@explicit0ceans I don't either. Why would you want to make people have kids? Esp when they're not prepared? Makes no sense. 
True progressives work toward greater inclusion and protections for the marginalized. Standing up for the unborn is progressive! 
MT @ProLifePolitics- Senate vote on SC Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act could come as early as Wed. Contact your senators! 
Equal pay for equal work? YES. Freedom from the fear of rape and sexual objectification? YES. The 'right' to abort? NO. 
@explicit0ceans whoa whoa whoa. I don't care about you having sex, but when you're pregnant, there's another life involved. 
Today I am grateful to have the right to control my body without govt influence. leaders want to stop this. 
Sadly, most health insurance plans don't cover abortions, so the price can be quite high.... 
@Britt_Ghiroli @mboyle1 But the Mayor of Baltimore said to give rioters to rioters. 
It is so much fun having younger friends who are expecting babies. 
Why is it illegal to kill an unhatched eagle egg but its legal to kill an unborn human baby?isright 
I refuse to let people like you shame and insult women for accessing healthcare. Sorry. Just no. 
pro-life? no you're more pro-birth then after that the baby can support itself!!! 
U know what isn't funny? Male politicians deciding what women should do with their body's. 
I was born 4 months premature... I'm perfectly fine, somehow killing babies is legal in this country. 
You can't kill someone cause you claim you made a mistake. If true nobody would go to jail for killing their spouse. 
@Corey_Frizzell @PEILiberalParty and most Islanders have different definitions of "timely access". 
@Docjp Pressure? It's their job and they are failing miserably at keeping the promises they made. 
I love how only accuse of war on women when we don't want to fund 
Help your friend figure out how they're going to get there and where to stay if they need to spend the night 
@JimDDaniels1 Plenty of reasons for Christians not to support Hillary. Not the least of which in my mind is her stand (w/Dems) on
